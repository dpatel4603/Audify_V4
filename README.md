# Audify_V4

The App.js file runs the app itself by running the file MainContainter.js
Maincontainer.js consists of 4 different files: HomeScreen.js, Audiogram.js, Recorder_1.js, and HelpandOptions.js
Each of these files contain code that runs each respective file, with Recorder_1 doing the sound filter in real time and with the
Audiogram.js giving input to the Recorder_1 to do correct filtering.
